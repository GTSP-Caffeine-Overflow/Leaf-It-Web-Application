* Leaf It is a project designed, created, and delivered by 3rd-year engineering students at San Jose State University located in San Jose, California.
* Our idea was simple but powerful: Allow users to paste in a product link, and our service will take care of the rest. The client will be greeted with product alternatives ranked by their energy efficiencies.
